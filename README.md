## simple way to create linux machines on your local for research and development ##

Download and install VirtualBox from the official website: https://www.virtualbox.org/

1. Download and install Vagrant from the official website: https://www.vagrantup.com/


2. Create a new directory on your local machine where you want to store your Vagrant project
    (preferably a folder and sub-folder on your desktop).

3. Open your command-line interface (CLI) and navigate to the directory you created.

4. Run the command 'vagrant init'. 
    This will initialize a new Vagrantfile in your directory.


5. Open the Vagrantfile in a text editor(im using VScode).

    Customize the configuration according to your requirements. For example, you can specify the base box, network settings, and provisioning scripts.
