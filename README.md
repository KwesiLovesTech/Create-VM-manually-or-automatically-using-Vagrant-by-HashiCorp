##simple way to create linux machines on your local for research and development##

Download and install VirtualBox from the official website: https://www.virtualbox.org/

Download and install Vagrant from the official website: https://www.vagrantup.com/


Create a new directory on your local machine where you want to store your Vagrant project
(preferably a folder and sub-folder on your desktop).

Open your command-line interface (CLI) and navigate to the directory you created.

Run the command 'vagrant init'. 
This will initialize a new Vagrantfile in your directory.


Open the Vagrantfile in a text editor(im using VScode).

Customize the configuration according to your requirements. For example, you can specify the base box, network settings, and provisioning scripts.
